Project Submission Getting and cleaning data

Note: The output file Project.txt has 180 rows and 68 columns with the means calculated
The R file run_analysis.R has plenty of comments explaining the steps

the column naming conventions are not standardized completely, hence have used the feature names 
as they do not contain dots, there are upper cases but since we are not going to type the column names, this does not matter
